Name:Tusky
Summary:Tusky
Description:
Tusky is a beautiful Android client for Mastodon. Mastodon is a GNU
social-compatible federated social network. That means not one entity controls
the whole network, rather, like e-mail, volunteers and organisations operate
their own independent servers, users from which can all interact with each other
seamlessly.

This apps rely on FireBird google push function.
